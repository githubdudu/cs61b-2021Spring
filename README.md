This a repo of assignments (including labs and projects) and exercises answers 
(in the guide page) of CS61b Spring 2021.

1. Code assignments repo. And used for Gradescope auto grade.
2. Exercises(in the guide page of every lecture) and their solutions with Markdown format written in Typora or coding software and PDF format generated by Goodnotes.

I've tried my best to have searched every corner of Internet, there is hardly any solutions to the exercises (in the guide page), though there are lots of answers to the labs, exams and homework.

There are two or three blogs about the exercises but the authors gave up updating the posts after three or four lectures. 

There is ONLY one valuable blog that contains exercises, although not covering most of the questions but it covers the whole courses: [Study Notes | Forkercat](https://www.junhaow.com/studynotes/#cs-61b-data-structures)
